# ONLY WORKS ON THE DIGITAL VERSION OF ISHIN!!!
# Info
This repo contains chapter 1-8 cutscenes translated by KHH guide videos from youtube AND chapter 1-2 main story text boxes and tutorials with correct translations from the GT patch.<br><br>First two chapters are 100% working, while after them I do not know if other chapters work (but they should as  I hex edited everything without deleting bytes), since I have no time to test. If anyone discovers this repo and decides to test, please report any text not fitting the screen or cutscenes not working at all to the issues tab.<br><br>
I am planning to finish this project by fully translating the cutscene text up to the finale of the game.

# How to use the files
BEFORE DOING ANYTHING BACKUP YOUR OLD FILES!!!<br><br>
Download the auth folder from this repo and paste the cutscene files in your Ishin data folder.<br>
For text boxes and tutorials download the boot.par, wdr.par, pause.par, street_name.dat, stay.par files and put them in their folders.

# Issues
The issues remain the same as in the GT patch. After fully translating the remaining 6 chapters, I will make a patch to revert the GT patch changes (by overwriting the english files) so that it would be easier to solve the softlock issue.
